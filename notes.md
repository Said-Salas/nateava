What do I need to know from the business?

Make it end-to-end. Super easy. 

Prompt:
    This is a real app. I want to build software to help a business run efficiently by: using AI Agents to make invoices for me, software than handles inventory and with natural language I can update prices and existences using the Gemini API; Gemini would then go to the database and make the changes for me. I want AI to make orders for me and track them (I just want it to notify me prior making the order). I want to build an UI that customers will use in the store to order their drinks (we are a tea house). I want the software make the cash closing autonomously and send the data to the person in charge of the numbers. I want the ticket that the barista receives after the clients have ordered and paid to highlight mayor details like the type of milk, whether it is to eat at the store or to go or for Uber Eats. I want to implement AI that will check the security cameras for me all day and let me know when it detects suspicius behavior (like staff eating goods or stealing cash). I want to also make it easy to notify everyone about what happened at the store (log book that can be filled with text or voice. Gemini will transcribe it to be much clearer and formal). I want to add a function to enable easily editability of the recipe book--from the app, I can access the recipe book to review how to make a drink but also to edit how to make a drink (if I have the permission).
